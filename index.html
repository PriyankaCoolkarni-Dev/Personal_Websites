            <h1>Health: Sustainability Over Intensity</h1>
            
            <p class="section-intro">The health advice industry runs on urgency. Transform in 30 days. Optimize every metric. Push harder, track everything, never stop improving.</p>
            
            <p class="section-intro">This creates burnout, not health.</p>

            <p>Real health is quieter. It's about building systems you can maintain for decades. It's about understanding your body's signals instead of overriding them. It's about energy that lasts, not peaks that crash.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Movement as Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Your body needs regular movement the way it needs sleep. Not because you need to look different, but because sitting still for 10 hours damages you.</p>

                <p>The question isn't "What's the best workout?" The question is "What can I sustain?"</p>

                <p>For most working professionals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>30 minutes of movement, 5 days a week, is sufficient</li>
                    <li>Walking counts. Stairs count. Stretching counts.</li>
                    <li>Intensity matters less than consistency</li>
                    <li>The best exercise is the one you'll actually do</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can you walk to meetings instead of sitting in conference rooms?</li>
                    <li>Can you take calls standing or pacing?</li>
                    <li>Do you have 20 minutes before breakfast or after work?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The goal isn't transformation. It's not falling apart.</p>

                <div class="reflection">What movement could you sustain for the next 10 years?</div>
            </section>

                <h2>Your Mind Needs Rest, Not More Productivity</h2>
                <p>You spend 8-12 hours a day processing information, making decisions, solving problems. Your mind needs recovery time, not optimization hacks.</p>

                <p>Mental fatigue shows up as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decision paralysis</li>
                    <li>Irritability</li>
                    <li>Difficulty focusing</li>
                    <li>Feeling overwhelmed by small tasks</li>
                    <li>The need to escape (social media, news, streaming)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Rest doesn't mean doing nothing. It means doing things that don't require performance.</p>

                <h3>Practices that restore mental capacity:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Walking without music or podcasts</li>
                    <li>Sitting without a phone for 10 minutes</li>
                    <li>One task at a time (no multitasking)</li>
                    <li>Regular sleep schedule (same time every day)</li>
                    <li>Saying no to non-essential commitments</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The insight: Your attention is finite. Treat it like the limited resource it is.</p>

                <h2>Emotional Resilience</h2>
                <p>There's a cultural push to process every emotion, to be vulnerable, to express everything. This exhausts people who already feel too much.</p>

                <p>Emotional resilience isn't about openness. It's about stability. It's about not being knocked sideways by every disappointment, criticism, or setback.</p>

                <p>This requires:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Knowing which emotions signal real problems vs. which ones pass on their own</li>
                    <li>Having one or two people you can be honest with (not everyone)</li>
                    <li>Building routines that keep you grounded when external circumstances are chaotic</li>
                    <li>Understanding that not every feeling needs action</li>
                </ul>

                <p>For professionals carrying responsibility: You need emotional stability more than emotional fluency. You need to be able to make clear decisions even when you're anxious, frustrated, or uncertain.</p>

                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> When emotions spike, ask: "What needs to change?" vs. "What am I feeling?" One leads to action. The other leads to endless processing.</p>
